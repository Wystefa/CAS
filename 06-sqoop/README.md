# Data Movement with Sqoop

In this workshop we will use Apache Sqoop to load data from a relational Database into Hadoop HDFS. 

[Apache Sqoop(TM)](https://sqoop.apache.org/) is a tool designed for efficiently transferring bulk data between Apache] Hadoop and structured data stores such as relational databases. We will be using Sqoop Version 1 as the latest version 2 is not yet widely supported by the different Hadoop distributions. 

Start a bash shell in the `hadoop-client` container.

```
docker exec -ti hadoop-client bash
```

Set the `HADOOP_COMMON_HOME` environment variable

```
export HADOOP_COMMON_HOME=/opt/hadoop-3.1.1/
```

and also the `HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME ` environment variable

```
export HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME=/opt/hadoop-3.1.1
```

Then navigate to the `lib` folder of the Apache Sqoop installation

```
cd /usr/local/sqoop-1.4.7.bin__hadoop-2.6.0/lib
```

and download the PostgreSQL JDBC driver lib

```
curl -L 'http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/postgresql/postgresql/42.2.5/postgresql-42.2.5.jar' -o postgresql-42.2.5.jar
```

This is necessary, as we are going to use Sqoop to import data from the PostgreSQL instance.

### Load the DRIVER table with the `as-textfile` option

Letâ€™s start by importing the `truck` table. From a terminal window, again first open a bash shell in the `hadoop-client` container 

```
docker exec -ti hadoop-client bash
```

and then perform the following Sqoop `import` command

```
sqoop import \
    --connect 'jdbc:postgresql://postgresql:5432/truckdb' \
    --driver org.postgresql.Driver \
    --username truck  \
    --password truck \
    --table driver \
    --fields-terminated-by '\t' \
    --warehouse-dir truck/data
```

It will start a MapReduce job to import the data of the `truck` table into HDFS. By default the `--as-textfile` option is used, which will load the data as tab delimited text file (due to the `--fields-terminated-by` option). You should see an output similar to that:

```
root@hadoop-client:/usr/local/sqoop-1.4.7.bin__hadoop-2.6.0/lib# sqoop import \
>     --connect 'jdbc:postgresql://postgresql:5432/truckdb' \
>     --driver org.postgresql.Driver \
>     --username truck  \
>     --password truck \
>     --table driver \
>     --fields-terminated-by '\t' \
>     --warehouse-dir truck/data

```

Let's check in HDFS that the data has really been loaded. You can either use **Hue** or the `hadoop fs` command which is also available in the `hadoop-client` container. Sqoop is running as user root, therefore the data in HDFS is stored under `/user/root`.

```
hadoop fs -ls /user/root/truck/data/driver
```

The subfolder `truck/data` is the one provided in the sqoop command and sqoop creates another subfolder for each table, in our case `driver`:

```
root@hadoop-client:/# hadoop fs -ls /user/root/truck/data/driver
WARNING: HADOOP_PREFIX has been replaced by HADOOP_HOME. Using value of HADOOP_PREFIX.

```

We have loaded the data of one of the tables into HDFS. We used the `as-textfile` option, which is the default. 

Letâ€™s retry it with the `as-avrodatafile` option. 

### Load the `truck` table with the `as-avrodatafile` option

Letâ€™s first clear the data we have loaded by removing the `driver` folder

```
hadoop fs -rm -R /user/root/truck/data/driver
```

In Hue navigate to the `/truck/data` folder and click on drop down icon next to Move to trash and click on Delete forever.

Now perform the sqoop import with the `--as-avrodatafile` option. Additionally, we also use the `--compression-codec` option to compress the data.

```
sqoop import -Dmapreduce.job.user.classpath.first=true \
   --connect 'jdbc:postgresql://postgresql:5432/truckdb' \
   --driver org.postgresql.Driver \
   --username truck \
   --password truck \
   --table driver \
   --compression-codec=snappy \
   --as-avrodatafile \
   --warehouse-dir truck/data
```

Let's again check in HDFS that the data has really been loaded as Avro serialized data.

```
hadoop fs -ls /user/root/truck/data/driver
```

Again there are 4 files, one for each mapper started in parallel

```
